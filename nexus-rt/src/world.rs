//! Type-erased singleton resource storage.
//!
//! [`World`] is a unified store where each resource type gets a dense index
//! ([`ResourceId`]) for O(1) dispatch-time access. Registration happens through
//! [`WorldBuilder`], which freezes into an immutable [`World`] container via
//! [`build()`](WorldBuilder::build).
//!
//! The type [`Registry`] maps types to dense indices. It is shared between
//! [`WorldBuilder`] and [`World`], and is passed to [`Param::init`] and
//! [`IntoHandler::into_handler`](crate::IntoHandler::into_handler) so that handlers can resolve their parameter
//! state during driver setup — before or after `build()`.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! let mut builder = WorldBuilder::new();
//! builder.register::<PriceCache>(value);
//! builder.register::<TimerDriver>(value);
//!
//! // Drivers can resolve handlers against builder.registry()
//! // before World is built.
//!
//! let world = builder.build();  // → World (frozen)
//! ```
//!
//! After `build()`, the container is frozen — no inserts, no removes. All
//! [`ResourceId`] values are valid for the lifetime of the [`World`] container.
