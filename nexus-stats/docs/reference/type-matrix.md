## Integer vs Float Decision

**Use integer types when:**
- Signal is naturally integer (nanoseconds, ticks, counts)
- No floating point is available (embedded `no_std`)
- You want deterministic results (no float rounding)

**Use float types when:**
- Signal is naturally continuous (prices, rates, percentages)
- Algorithm requires division or transcendentals (Welford, Kalman, Holt)
- You need exponential smoothing with fine-grained alpha

## Feature-Gated Types

| Feature | What it enables |
|---------|----------------|
| `std` (default) | Hardware `sqrt`/`exp` for Welford, ShiryaevRoberts, etc. |
| `libm` | Pure Rust `sqrt`/`exp` for `no_std` environments |
| `alloc` (planned) | Runtime-sized windows for MOSUM, WindowedMedian, KAMA, BoolWindow |
